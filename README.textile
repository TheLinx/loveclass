h1. Using LÖVE-class in your LÖVE game

If your game folder is a git repository, using an up-to-date LÖVE-class is easy.
Just be in the root folder of your game's source code, and issue the following command:

bc. git submodule add http://github.com/TheLinx/LOVE-class.git [optional: where to put LÖVE-class]

If you just want to download the source code, use this command:

bc. git clone http://github.com/TheLinx/LOVE-class.git

Then, just require @loveclass.init@.
Make sure to call @loveclass.update@ in your @love.update@!
